# Upgrading ImagineAPI

To get the latest version of ImagineAPI run:

```sh copy
docker-compose pull
```

You'll see the Docker images that have updates get downloaded:

```
$ docker-compose pull
Pulling database ... done
Pulling rabbitmq ... done
Pulling api      ... done
Pulling bot      ... done
Pulling autoheal ... done
```

Then start the containers that got updates:

```sh copy
docker-compose up -d
```
