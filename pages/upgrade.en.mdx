# Upgrading ImagineAPI

<Steps>

### Get the latest code from Github
To get the latest version of ImagineAPI.dev run:

```sh copy
git pull
```

<Callout>
`git pull` most often will not contain any changes. Continue with the rest of the update steps either way.
</Callout>

### Get Docker image updates

To get the latest `docker-compose.yml` and related files.

Then pull the new Docker image(s):

```sh copy
docker compose pull
```

You'll see the Docker images that have updates get downloaded:

```
$ docker compose pull
Pulling database ... done
Pulling rabbitmq ... done
Pulling api      ... done
Pulling bot      ... done
Pulling autoheal ... done
```

### Re-create Docker containers using new images

Then start the containers that got updates:

```sh copy
docker compose up -d
```
