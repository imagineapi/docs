# Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error, please tell us about it by sending some logs.

## Sending logs

Most issues will be related to the *bot* service. It's helpful to get those logs so we can help you troubleshoot.

1. Compress the logs folder (`./bots/logs`): \
`tar czvf bots.tar.gz bot/logs`
2. Upload it somewhere or email it as an attachment at [support@imagineapi.dev](mailto:support@imagineapi.dev)
