# Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error, please tell us about it by sending some logs.

## Sending logs

Most issues will be related to the *bot* service. It's helpful to get those logs so we can help you troubleshoot.

1. Compress the logs folder (`./bots/logs`):

```sh copy
tar czvf bots.tar.gz bot/logs
```

2. Email bots.tar.gz to [support@imagineapi.dev](mailto:support@imagineapi.dev) or upload on Dropbox or Google Drive and send us a link.
