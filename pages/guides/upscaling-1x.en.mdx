# Upscaling Midjourney Image 1x â€” 1024x1024

You do not need to do anything special to upscale an image by 1x. The API provides this by default.

After an image is generated, when you call [GET /items/image/:id](/aypeeeye/image#get-itemsimagesid), it returns `upscaled_urls` with upscaled image URLs in an array.
