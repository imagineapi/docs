# Status

All methods required to provide an [authorization token](/API/authentication).

## `GET /items/status`

You can check the ImagineAPI status using this endpoint. Requests you send when `bot_status` is not `healthy` will be queued and they will run once the bot becomes healthy and starts accepting requests again. 

Returns: 

```json
{
    "data": {
		"bot_status": "healthy" | "unhealthy" | "starting" | "paused" ,
		"date_created": "2023-04-05T15:47:43.573Z",
		"date_updated": "2023-04-26T05:33:17.683Z",
		"id": 1,
		"message": null,
		"user_created": null,
		"user_updated": null
	}
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
If the bot *is processing requests without issue* and `bot_status` is showing `unhealthy`, please [send a support request with the logs](/troubleshooting).
